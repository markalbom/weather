# Group Exercise: The Weather App!!!

Wait a second... I think I've heard that before...

Yup! You've built a weather app already, BUT today you will rebuild it using REACT and as a part of a team! ðŸ˜‰

#### First things first: Flow

* Git Tzar will create a `new` repository under their GitHub account and adds the team members as collaborators.
* As a team, agree upon the responsibilities of each memeber.
> Note: You have to sketch your app first, break it down into components and designate work to each member of the team.
* Create a separate branch for each member to work on 
> Note: make sure to give semantic names to your branches: Ex. "api-call-feature". 
> Do not name your branches this way: `kates-branch` (it's not explicit what work was done there)
* Each contributor should be creating Pull Requests that should be approved by ALL members of the team.

### A quick reminder of how your app should look:

#### Desktop

.... but feel free to [get creative](http://statistician-ostritch-38230.bitballoon.com/).

### Open Weather API

Hopefully you remember working with the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/api). If you don't, check out the [original readme](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-dresselhaus/weather-ajax-api-node-quiz-hw/blob/master/api/README.md).


## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

Your app has multiple components and does the following things:

- Handles the zip code input from the user
- Fetches data using axios from the API when the zip code is submitted 
- Parses the information that comes back from the API call
- Renders that information on the page
- **BONUS**: Include the sunrise and sunset times (hint: maybe [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) will be helpful!) and some information about humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc.
- **BONUS**: Upload your completed weather app to BitBalloon.

Things to think about:

- Should your app have state?
- How/when would you change state?
- What way will you make the API call?


## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- An issue ticket created on this repo. Make sure to include all members' names in the title. 
- A link to your **Separate** standing repository that ALL team members have contributed to
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ 11PM ON THURSDAY NIGHT ðŸš¨
