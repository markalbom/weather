#  The Weather App Â ðŸ™Œ !!!

Wait a second... I think I've heard that before...

Yup! You've built a weather app already, BUT today you will rebuild it using REACT! ðŸ˜‰

### A quick reminder of how your app should look:

#### Desktop

![desktop](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-hamilton/weather-ajax-api-hw/blob/master/api/assets/desktop.jpg)

.... but feel free to [get creative](http://statistician-ostritch-38230.bitballoon.com/).

### Open Weather API

Hopefully you remember working with the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/api). If you don't, check out the [original readme](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-hamilton/weather-ajax-api-hw/blob/master/README.md).


## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

Your app has multiple components and does the following things:

- Handles the zip code input from the user
- Fetches data using axios from the API when the zip code is submitted 
- Parses the information that comes back from the API call
- Renders that information on the page
- **BONUS**: Include the sunrise and sunset times (hint: maybe [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) will be helpful!) and some information about humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc.
- **BONUS**: Upload your completed weather app to BitBalloon. (Chcek out the pokemon assignment for the instructions ;))

Things to think about:

- Should your app have state?
- How/when would you change state?
- What way will you make the API call?


## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- A Pull Request created on this repo
- A link to your Bitballoon hosted App
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ 11PM ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT ðŸš¨
